The older 2.x\nrelease supports them, but you MUST set the configuration option \npointerResolutionBasePath\n eventually through\nthe environment variable \nswagger_swagger_editorConfig_pointerResolutionBasePath\n.\n\n\nTo handle validation of responses you MUST set a NodeJS listener on the swagger-node-runner\nbefore starting the server, see https://github.com/theganyo/swagger-node-runner/releases/tag/v0.6.4\nfor a working example.\n\n\nswagger-codegen\n\n\nhttps://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen\n\n\nNeeds java + maven. Does not generate mock data.\n\n\nUses swagger-tools which, when used standalone, remove the\nneed to compile the java version of swagger-codegen: see\n\nhttps://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools/blob/master/docs/QuickStart.md\n\n\nYou'd better start with swagger-tools or swagger-node directly.\n\n\nswagger-tools\n\n\nswagger-node uses swagger-tools to set up its server.\nAnyway, swagger-tools can be used standalone (without the bagpipes boilerplate):\n\n\nhttps://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools/blob/master/docs/QuickStart.md\n\n\nswagger-express-middleware\n\n\nhttps://github.com/BigstickCarpet/swagger-express-middleware\n\n\nIs a modern (unofficial) version of swagger-tools for express\n(while swagger-tools are targeted as a connect middleware).\n\n\nThe project seems better maintained and popular than swagger-tools (~300k downloads on npm).\nIt lacks the routing middleware (so you have to use it with something like \nswagger-routes\n).\n\n\nIt has an in-memory database to test mocked resources.\n\n\nswagger-server\n\n\nUses swagger-express-middleware to implement a server (like swagger-node does with swagger-tools).\nIt provides the express routing middleware that swagger-express-middleware lacks.\n\n\nloopback-swagger-generator\n\n\nhttps://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/Swagger-generator.html\n\n\nGenerates routes and models (for persistence) from swagger specs.\n\n\nPrism\n\n\nhttp://stoplight.io/platform/prism/\n\n\nIt\u2019s a free mock Swagger server from Spotlight.io.

            "text": "swaggerize  https://github.com/krakenjs/swaggerize-express  Mocks come from \u201cswagmock\u201d, but only this fork of swagmock: https://github.com/fhoek/swagmock \nsupports \" allOf \" OpenAPI operator, so you MUST use this version and\nnot the one that comes from the original package.json in order to make it work:  cat users.json |sed -e 's/faker/x\\\\-faker/' &gt; .tmp && mv .tmp users.json\nnpm install --save https://github.com/fhoek/swagmock  json-schema-faker  https://github.com/json-schema-faker/json-schema-faker  Supports swagger format and generates 1 json with fake data for each endpoint  You can use it directly with https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-routes  without using swaggerize.  swagger-node  Based on  sway  AND  swagger-tools .  Sway (aside sway-connect middleware) was supposed to supersede swagger-tools,\nbut has it lacks feature parity (and a good documentation), swagger-node falls back\nto swagger-tools for some tasks (mostly, validation).  If you want to use it in mock mode you MUST add for every path the directive:  \"x-swagger-router-controller\": \"controllerName\"  see https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-node/issues/342  swagger-node can emit some fake data (simple strings), but you can write custom controllers to mock it.\nThis activity is  mandatory  whenever there is a validation on the field format (ie. an email field)\notherwise the response object will fail validation (when responses validation is on).  swagger-node (swagger-tools) makes use of  bagpipes , a weird\nframework to code in YAML things you'd better write in Javascript.  There are a lot of gotchas using swagger-node and the documentation is poor.  As  swagger-tools  swagger-node seems  deprecated / unmantained : \nhttps://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools/issues/335.  It does not support  $ref to relative path ,\nso you MUST use  json-refs  to resolve them\nbefore plugging the express middleware.  If you have multiple spec files, you MUST start one HTTP (API) server for each one\nor using different mount points, see https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools/issues/126.  To change default location of spec files ( api/swagger/swagger.yaml ) you MUST set an\nenvironment variable before running the swagger cli, see https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-node/issues/373.  Swagger Editor 3.x (the tool that starts executing  swagger project edit ) does not support\n$references to local files (see https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-editor/issues/1409). The older 2.x\nrelease supports them, but you MUST set the configuration option  pointerResolutionBasePath  eventually through\nthe environment variable  swagger_swagger_editorConfig_pointerResolutionBasePath .  To handle validation of responses you MUST set a NodeJS listener on the swagger-node-runner\nbefore starting the server, see https://github.com/theganyo/swagger-node-runner/releases/tag/v0.6.4\nfor a working example.  swagger-codegen  https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen  Needs java + maven. Does not generate mock data.  Uses swagger-tools which, when used standalone, remove the\nneed to compile the java version of swagger-codegen: see https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools/blob/master/docs/QuickStart.md  You'd better start with swagger-tools or swagger-node directly.  swagger-tools  swagger-node uses swagger-tools to set up its server.\nAnyway, swagger-tools can be used standalone (without the bagpipes boilerplate):  https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools/blob/master/docs/QuickStart.md  swagger-express-middleware  https://github.com/BigstickCarpet/swagger-express-middleware  Is a modern (unofficial) version of swagger-tools for express\n(while swagger-tools are targeted as a connect middleware).  The project seems better maintained and popular than swagger-tools (~300k downloads on npm).\nIt lacks the routing middleware (so you have to use it with something like  swagger-routes ).  It has an in-memory database to test mocked resources.  swagger-server  Uses swagger-express-middleware to implement a server (like swagger-node does with swagger-tools).\nIt provides the express routing middleware that swagger-express-middleware lacks.  loopback-swagger-generator  https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/Swagger-generator.html  Generates routes and models (for persistence) from swagger specs.  Prism  http://stoplight.io/platform/prism/  It\u2019s a free mock Swagger server from Spotlight.io. The bad part is you\nMUST embed some javascript code inside the Swagger specs to customize\ncontrollers, which is not ideal.",
